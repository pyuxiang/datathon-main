# Datathon 2.0
## How to use
File the fault logs and chiller statistics under data.
Clone repository and run the relevant parsers with Python.

## TODO:
1. Complete batch parsing of log faults
2. Rewrite parser to allow arbitrary start and end date time
3. Write merger to merge training data and labels
4. Write splitter to demarcate subdivision of training dataset / generate labels with the same dimension
